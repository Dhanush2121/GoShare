# ShareRide
RideShare is a full-stack carpooling web application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to register, log in, create ride offers, search for rides, and book available rides in real-time. This app is designed to simplify shared travel while reducing costs and environmental impact.
